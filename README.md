Papiea, pronounced like the fruit, is an Intent engine based on perscriptions or recipes for handling differences
between intended state and real world state.

## Design document

Please see [Papiea's design document](https://nutanix.github.io/papiea/Papiea-design.html)

## Papiea versions:

| Component  | Version |
| ------------- | ------------- |
  | Engine (docker) | nutanix-docker.jfrog.io/papiea:0.7.18_1649 |
  | Client/SDK (typescript)  | 0.7.18+1649 |
  | Client/SDK (python)  | 0.7.18+1649 |

## Build Instructions Papiea

Since papiea consists of multiple package you need to build them all
separately or use a set of commands to build them all

1. In the project root install and build all dependencies `make build_all`. (Note you need to have yarn installed
, how to install yarn https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)

## Local Development Instructions Papiea-Engine

Papiea-Engine is the main component that serves web requests and integrates intentful engine
with entity information stores in a database. Make sure that you have Docker and Docker-compose since they are required to run Papiea-Engine

1. In the project root cd into papiea engine package `cd papiea-engine`

2. To start a container `docker-compose up -d`

Papiea-Engine will now be running on port `3000` inside the container and will use port `3333` externally

To stop a container

1. `docker-compose stop`

## Debug configuration Papiea-Engine

Instead of using usual `docker-compose up` in papiea-engine dir, use `docker-compose -f docker-compose-debug.yml up` to enable hot-reload and debugger listening on port `9229`
See [Attaching to node js using VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/nodejs-debugging#_attaching-to-nodejs)
See [Attaching to node js using Intellij](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/running-and-debugging-node-js.html#a34dc5da)

## Benchmarking Local Papiea

1. Start papiea using `docker-compose up` in the papiea-engine dir

2. `docker-compose exec papiea-engine bash -c 'cd __benchmarks__ && npm i && npm run bench-local'`

## Benchmarking Dedicated Papiea

1. From project root `cd papiea-engine/__benchmarks__`

2. Install dependencies by `yarn` (Note you need to have yarn installed https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)

3. `npm run bench -- {PAPIEA_URL} {PUBLIC_HOST} {PUBLIC_PORT}` where PAPIEA_URL is a dedicated papiea_url, PUBLIC_HOST is your sdk publicly visible hostname, PUBLIC_PORT is your sdk publicly visible port

OPTIONALLY: you can use AWS Cloudformation stack to setup benchmark environment, to do that you:

1. Upload `papiea-engine/__benchmarks__/aws_template/benchmark.json` as a template or use `https://papiea-bucket.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/benchmark.json`

2. SSH to mongo-instance 

3. Do `cd mongo && docker-compose -f docker-compose-mongo.yml up -d`

3. SSH to papiea-instance 

4. `export MONGO_URL='mongod://${MONGO_INSTANCE_PUBLIC_IP}:27017'`

5. `git clone https://github.com/nutanix/papiea-js.git`

6. `cd papiea-js/papiea-engine`

7. `docker-compose -f docker-compose-benchmark.yml up -d`

Now you can use your `${PAPIEA_INSTANCE_PUBLIC_IP}:3333` as PAPIEA_URL in benchmarks

## Environment Papiea-Engine

Papiea uses configuration file to apply settings. Sample config file is located in `papiea-engine/papiea-config.json`.
The configuration parameters are following:

```
# Server port (default - 3000)
server_port: number,

# Public facing papiea address (default - "http://localhost:3000")
public_addr: string,

# Mongo url (default - "mongodb://mongo:27017")
mongo_url: string,

# Mongo Db collection name to store papiea entities in (default - "papiea")
mongo_db: string,

# Papiea Admin S2S key (default - "")
admin_key: string,

# Papiea debug mode toggle (default - true)
debug: boolean,

# Default logging level for papiea (default - "info")
logging_level: string,

# Size of batch of random entities to be added to diff resolution each N seconds (default - 5)
entity_batch_size: number,

# Deleted watcher persists in database for this amount of seconds (default - 100)
deleted_watcher_persist_time: number

# Delay for polling entity changes in database in milliseconds (default - 250)
entity_poll_delay: number

# Delay for observing intent watcher status change in milliseconds (default - 1500)
intent_resolve_delay: number

# Delay for rediffing watcher entities in milliseconds (default - 3000)
diff_resolve_delay: number
```

A set of these variables might be used to override the preceeding config file params.
General pattern is - PAPIEA_{VARIABLE_NAME_CAPITALIZED}

* `PAPIEA_MONGO_URL`
* `PAPIEA_PUBLIC_URL`
* `PAPIEA_LOGGING_LEVEL`
* `PAPIEA_DEBUG`
* `PAPIEA_ADMIN_KEY`

Additional env variables:

* `HOT_RELOAD` - use nodemon to autoreload papiea on code changes
* `PAPIEA_CONFIG_PATH` - path to config file (default - `../../papiea-config.yaml` rootDir is counted from `papiea
-engine/src/utils`)


## CLJS instructions

For now this clojurescript library is embedded, but it may end up in a different repository and will be exposed as a regular npm package which will be imported through npm. Until this happens, here are the instructions for developing this library:

1. Make sure `leiningen` is installed (follow [leiningen installation](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen#installation))
2. To use live repl with clojurescript do the following:

    ```bash
    cd papiea-lib-clj
    lein repl
    ```

    and inside the repl type:

    ```clojure
    (require 'cljs.repl.nashorn)
    (cider.piggieback/cljs-repl (cljs.repl.nashorn/repl-env))
    ```

    Then go to emacs with cider installed
    ([Cider Installation](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider#installation)), do `M+x cider-connect-cljs`,
    select the host where the repl is running (usually localhost, but can be run anywhere.
    Use `.ssh/config` to name that host), then select `node` as the running environment and you should have a repl.
    Debugging is not yet working in cljs, but I simply use regular clojure if I need to live debug for now.

## Issuing a bug report

While issuing a bug report please make sure you created an issue https://github.com/nutanix/papiea/issues with the 
following info (make sure to use the right template):

1. General description of the error

2. Code samples or path which were used during problematic scenario execution

3. Prerequisites: yaml definitions for spec, metadata extension, auth info if present

4. Steps that caused the unwanted scenario
   e.g. Defined a provider X, with procedure Y, provided input of spec
   `{x: 10, y: 20}`, expected output of procedure was `{sum: 30}`, got `{sum: 10}`
   
Please make sure to:

1. Anonymize your code (no personal or corporate details present in the provided info)

2. Not link any private repositories

3. Use a bug report template

4. Give an issue label `bug`
